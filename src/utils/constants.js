  {
    question: "What exactly is high-intensity training (HIT)?",
    answer:
      "High-Intensity Training (HIT) in the context of stroke and SCI recovery refers to our evidence-based approach that maximizes neuroplasticity through intensive, task-specific exercises performed at higher intensities than traditional rehabilitation. Our protocols are designed to challenge the nervous system in ways that promote rapid neural adaptation and functional recovery. Unlike traditional therapy, our HIT focuses on pushing beyond comfort zones in a safe, supervised environment to achieve breakthrough results.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is your training offered in-person or online?",
    answer:
      "RISE bootcamps are conducted in-person to ensure the highest quality of care and optimal results. Our intensive programs require hands-on guidance, real-time assessment, and the ability to safely progress participants through challenging exercises. We travel to various locations across the country to make our programs accessible. While we offer some educational resources and follow-up support online, the core bootcamp experience is exclusively in-person.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "I've heard of HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training). How is your High-Intensity Training (HIT) different?",
    answer:
      "Great question! While HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) focuses on cardiovascular fitness through alternating high and low intensity periods, our HIT (High-Intensity Training) is specifically designed for neurological recovery. Our approach targets neuroplasticity, motor learning, and functional restoration through task-specific, progressive exercises. We focus on intensity of effort and challenge rather than just cardiovascular intensity, with protocols specifically developed for stroke and SCI survivors.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How many days is a typical bootcamp and what would we do each day?",
    answer:
      "RISE bootcamps typically run 3-5 days, with each day involving 6-8 hours of intensive training. Each day includes: individualized assessment and goal setting, high-intensity functional exercises, task-specific training, strength and conditioning, balance and coordination work, and family education sessions. We also incorporate rest periods and nutritional guidance. The exact schedule is customized based on each participant's needs, goals, and capabilities.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I get ready for a RISE bootcamp?",
    answer:
      "Preparation begins with a comprehensive consultation where we assess your current abilities, medical history, and goals. We'll provide specific pre-bootcamp exercises and recommendations based on your individual needs. Generally, we recommend: maintaining your current activity level, staying hydrated, getting adequate sleep, and mentally preparing for an intensive but rewarding experience. We'll work with your healthcare team to ensure you're ready for the physical and mental challenges ahead.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need any special, expensive equipment to do this?",
    answer:
      "No! One of the advantages of our approach is that we use readily available equipment and bodyweight exercises. We believe in functional training that translates to real-world activities. While we have specialized equipment available during bootcamps, our goal is to teach you techniques and exercises you can continue at home with minimal equipment. We focus on maximizing your body's potential rather than relying on expensive machines.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of support is provided AFTER a RISE bootcamp?",
    answer:
      "Our commitment doesn't end when the bootcamp does. Post-bootcamp support includes: a detailed home exercise program, ongoing check-ins and progress monitoring, access to our online community and resources, follow-up consultations, and referrals to qualified local therapists when needed. We also offer refresher sessions and advanced programs for continued growth. Our goal is to set you up for long-term success and continued improvement.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "I'm experiencing significant mobility challenges after my stroke. Can your program help me regain my ability to walk?",
    answer:
      "Many of our participants have experienced significant improvements in mobility, including regaining the ability to walk. However, every stroke is different, and we can't guarantee specific outcomes. What we can promise is that our evidence-based approach maximizes your potential for recovery. During your consultation, we'll honestly assess your situation and discuss realistic goals. Many participants achieve mobility improvements they thought were impossible, but we base our approach on your individual potential.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I learn more about RISE bootcamps?",
    answer:
      "The best way to learn more is to schedule a free consultation with our team. We'll discuss your specific situation, answer your questions, and determine if RISE is right for you. You can also explore our success stories, read testimonials from past participants, and review our methodology on this website. We're always happy to connect you with graduates of our program who can share their experiences.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the investment for a RISE bootcamp?",
    answer:
      "Investment varies based on the specific program, duration, and individual needs. We believe in transparent pricing and will provide detailed cost information during your consultation. We understand this is a significant investment, but consider the value of regaining independence, function, and quality of life. We also discuss payment options and can provide documentation for insurance reimbursement where applicable. The investment in your recovery is one of the most important decisions you can make.",
  },
  {
    question: "This sounds too good to be true! What's the catch?",
    answer:
      "We understand the skepticism - the results do sound remarkable! The 'catch' is that this requires intense effort, commitment, and stepping outside your comfort zone. Our methods are demanding both physically and mentally. Not everyone is ready for or willing to embrace the intensity required. However, for those who are committed to pushing their limits, the results speak for themselves. We're transparent about our methods, which are all evidence-based and published in peer-reviewed research.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "I'm a Therapist/clinician, do you offer CEUs as part of attending a bootcamp?",
    answer:
      "Yes! We offer continuing education credits for healthcare professionals who attend our training programs. Our bootcamps provide an excellent opportunity for therapists to learn our evidence-based protocols while earning CEUs. You'll gain hands-on experience with our methods, learn to implement high-intensity training safely, and see firsthand how these techniques transform patient outcomes. Contact us for specific CEU information and requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if this type of training is right for me?",
    answer:
      "The best candidates for RISE training are individuals who: are committed to pushing beyond their current limitations, are willing to embrace intensive training, have medical clearance for increased activity, and are motivated to achieve significant functional improvements. During your consultation, we'll assess your readiness, discuss your goals, and determine if our approach aligns with your needs and capabilities. We're honest about who will benefit most from our programs.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What if I have other health conditions that complicate my ability to participate?",
    answer:
      "We work with participants who have various health conditions beyond stroke or SCI. During your consultation, we'll review all your health conditions with your medical team to ensure safety. Our protocols can often be modified to accommodate other conditions while still maintaining the intensity needed for optimal results. Safety is our top priority, and we won't proceed unless we're confident we can help you safely achieve your goals.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you accept insurance?",
    answer:
      "We accept private pay only. We do not accept any type of insurance at this time.",
